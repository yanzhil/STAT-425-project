Data set: Hotel booking demand
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes in- formation such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, among other things. More information about the data can be found in Kaggle. I have modified the data set to analyze visitors whose origin is from the US only; and have excluded some variables from the original data. The modified file (stat425 fpdata.csv) has been uploaded in Compass and has 18 variables. There are two types of hotels (hotel variable): Resort Hotel and City Hotel. Section 01 will analyze the data segment corresponding to Resort Hotel. Section 02 will analyze the data segment corresponding to City Hotel.
